Welcome to Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications.
This course is a hands-on data analysis course that introduces the interplay between statistics and computation for the analysis of real data.

This course consists of an introduction (Module 1) and four modules (Modules 2-5). The introduction reviews some common statistical tools such as hypothesis tests, regression, and gradient descent methods. Each of the following 4 modules is centered around a specific type of data:
